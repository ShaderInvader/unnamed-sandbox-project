# Unnamed Sandbox Project

Unnamed Sandbox Project is a C++ game engine for testing various approaches to procedural sandbox Minecraft-like games.

## Installation

You'll need Cmake. Compiled the thing with MSVC, so you probably should too. I take no responsibility if something doesn't work.

## Contributing
If you want, you can IDK, diss my code or help me with developing this thing but don't expect any extraordinary support as I have very limited time at hand.
